# Treacherest Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current implementation status of the Treacherest project phases and key architectural decisions.

## Architecture
- **Backend Design**: See [Backend System Design](../architecture/backend/system-design.md)
- **Frontend Patterns**: See [Frontend UI Patterns](../architecture/frontend/ui-patterns.md)
- **Core Philosophy**: DOM as State using Server-Side Rendering with Datastar SSE updates

## Test Coverage
- **Coverage Reports Location**: `nix/app/build/coverage/`
- **Run Coverage**: `test-coverage` command in nix shell
- **Coverage Files**:
  - `build/coverage/coverage.out` - Coverage profile data
  - `build/coverage/coverage.html` - HTML coverage report

## Phase Status

### Phase 0: Testing Strategy ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
**Status**: Mostly Complete

#### Completed ✅
- [x] Test infrastructure set up (test commands available)
- [x] Unit tests for game logic (97.8% coverage in game package)
- [x] Test coverage reporting configured (outputs to `build/coverage/`)
- [x] Tests for store package (100% coverage)
- [x] Tests for HTTP handlers (66% coverage)
- [x] SSE event flow tests (tested StreamLobby and StreamGame)

#### Pending ❌
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Browser/E2E test setup
- [ ] Achieve >80% total code coverage (currently 28.8% total)

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes 🚫 BLOCKED
**Status**: Blocked on Phase 0 completion

#### Known Issues
- SSE updates throwing "NoTargetsFound" errors
- Join flow using hardcoded HTML instead of Templ templates
- Direct URL room joining not working properly

#### Requirements
- All fixes must have tests written FIRST (TDD)
- Cannot proceed until Phase 0 testing is complete

### Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics 🚫 NOT STARTED
**Status**: Blocked on Phase 0 and 1

### Phase 3: UI Polish and Mobile 🚫 NOT STARTED
**Status**: Blocked on previous phases

### Phase 4: Advanced Features 🚫 NOT STARTED
**Status**: Blocked on previous phases

## Current Code Coverage

| Package             | Coverage | Status                      |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| `internal/game`     | 97.8%    | ✅ Excellent                |
| `internal/store`    | 100%     | ✅ Excellent                |
| `internal/handlers` | 66%      | ⚠️ Good progress            |
| `cmd/server`        | 0%       | ❌ No tests                 |
| `internal/views`    | 0%       | ❌ No tests                 |
| **Total**           | 28.8%    | ❌ Below requirement (>80%) |

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go with Chi router for clean HTTP handling
- **Templates**: Templ for type-safe server-side rendering
- **Reactivity**: Datastar for SSE-based real-time updates
- **Testing**: Standard Go testing with table-driven tests
- **Development**: Nix for reproducible development environment

### 2. Key Architecture Patterns
- **DOM as State**: No client-side state management - DOM is the source of truth
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Centralized EventBus for real-time state propagation
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All shared state protected by mutexes
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between storage and business logic
- **Component-Based Templates**: Reusable Templ components for consistent UI

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Target >80% total coverage
- **Layer-Specific Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Concurrent Testing**: Verify thread safety and race conditions
- **SSE Testing**: Validate real-time update flows

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (Phase 0 Completion)
1. **Server Package Tests** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Test server setup and middleware
   - Test route configuration
   - Test static file serving
   - Target: 80%+ coverage

2. **View Template Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Test template rendering
   - Test component composition
   - Verify Datastar attributes
   - Target: 70%+ coverage

3. **Integration Test Suite** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Full HTTP request/response cycles
   - Multi-player scenarios
   - SSE connection lifecycle
   - Session management flows

4. **E2E Test Infrastructure** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Set up Playwright or similar
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Mobile browser testing
   - Network condition simulation

### Phase 1 Fix Strategy (After Phase 0)
1. **SSE NoTargetsFound Fix**
   - Write failing tests for SSE selectors
   - Ensure all fragments have proper IDs
   - Verify Datastar selector syntax
   - Test with multiple concurrent connections

2. **Join Flow Template Fix**
   - Replace hardcoded HTML with Templ component
   - Test all join scenarios
   - Verify error handling
   - Ensure consistent styling

3. **Direct URL Join Fix**
   - Test URL parsing and routing
   - Handle missing/invalid room codes
   - Proper error pages
   - Session cookie handling

### Phase 2-4 Preparation
1. **Game Mechanics Foundation**
   - Role assignment algorithm
   - Turn-based state machine
   - Action validation system
   - Victory condition checking

2. **UI Enhancement Patterns**
   - Animation framework
   - Sound effect integration
   - Mobile gesture support
   - Offline state handling

3. **Advanced Features Architecture**
   - Spectator mode design
   - Tournament system
   - Statistics tracking
   - Social features

## Testing Patterns Guide

### Unit Test Pattern
```go
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   InputType
        want    OutputType
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Test Pattern
```go
func TestEndpointIntegration(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    server := setupTestServer()
    defer server.Close()
    
    // Execute
    resp, err := http.Post(...)
    
    // Verify
    assert.Equal(t, expected, actual)
}
```

### SSE Test Pattern
```go
func TestSSEUpdates(t *testing.T) {
    // Create SSE connection
    // Trigger state change
    // Verify fragment received
    // Check selector targets
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 0 by writing tests for all untested packages
2. Fix critical bugs in Phase 1 using TDD approach
3. Only then proceed to Phase 2 game mechanics
