Paramount is to emulate the functionality of https://mtgtreachery.net/treacherer/ -- please browse this site and learn how it works, then update the PRD accordingly.

     "1. Role Clarification: The PRD mentions specific role abilities but doesn't clearly define all special abilities for each role. Should expand on:
       - Guardian's special abilities beyond "hidden identity"
       - Leader's investigation powers
       - Specific win condition priorities when multiple factions achieve goals simultaneously"

Answer: Win conditions are defined in the https://mtgtreachery.net rules and may be unique per-role. Keep this open to extension at this point.

     "2. Game State Transitions: Add clear state machine definition for game phases:
       - Pre-game (lobby)
       - Role distribution
       - Active play
       - End game conditions
       - Post-game"

Let's get this added into the PRD.

     "3. Persistence Strategy: The PRD mentions "In-memory game state (future: Redis)" but should define:
       - Game expiration policies
       - Reconnection grace periods
       - State recovery mechanisms"

         Don't worry about this for now

     "4. Security Considerations: Add more detail on:
       - Room code collision handling
       - Rate limiting for game creation
       - Maximum concurrent connections per game"

         Don't worry about this for now.


1. Role Distribution: Should we allow custom role configurations in Phase 1, or stick to preset distributions?
- Preset distribution based on default https://mtgtreachery.net/treacherer/ role distribution

2. Persistence: For Phase 0/1, is in-memory storage sufficient, or should we plan for Redis from the start?
   In-memory storage is sufficient

3. Authentication: The PRD mentions "no password/account system" - should we still track player statistics across sessions using browser fingerprinting or optional accounts?
   Just set a JWT, but this will come much later anyway.

4. Game History: Should games be archived after completion for replay/review?
   Games should be archived.

5. Concurrent Games: What's the expected load? Should we design for horizontal scaling from the start?
Concurrent games will be extremely low. Don't plan for this yet.
