If the targeted player would have lost the game due to having ten or more poison counters, their life total becomes 12, but they will lose the game immediately afterward because they still have ten or more poison counters.",

For example, if the targeted player’s life total is -4 when this card’s unveiling ability applies, it will cause that player to gain 16 life. Alternatively, if the targeted player’s life total is 20 when it applies (perhaps because they tried to draw a card from an empty library), they will lose 8 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.

The state-based actions rule is trying to simultaneously (a) shuffle that creature card into the player’s library (due to the Save replacement effect) and (b) put it into their graveyard. Only one of those things can happen. The creature’s controller chooses which one. If the creature is put into the graveyard, it isn’t shuffled into the library.

Instead, the targeted player will do what the Save effect says and their teammate won’t do anything. This is true even if the reason the team would lose is because the teammate tried to draw a card with an empty library or was affected by an ability that said they lost the game. The targeted player’s life total (which is the same as their team’s life total) becomes 12.
